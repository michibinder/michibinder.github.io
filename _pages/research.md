So far I did not manage to focus on a single subject. Not sure if I ever want to, so my research interests are quite broad and varied.  and I particularly like to mix and merge methods and models across disciplines. Here are some of the topics I am interested into

**Non-orographic gravity waves above propagating tropopause depressions**

Idealized numerical simulations:



**Snowpack modelling for avalanche forecasting**




**Snowpack visualizations**
