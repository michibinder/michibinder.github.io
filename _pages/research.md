For now my research interests are quite broad and varied. I enjoy programming and model development, but observations and data analysis often conclude the package and are just as interesting. Here are some of the topics I am interested into...


**Snowpack modelling for avalanche forecasting**

**Snowpro - a Python package for Snowpack model output visualization**

This package was developed to read and visualize .pro files (Snowpack model output). At the LWD Tyrol we use it for various Python based postprocessing applications.

**Idealized numerical simulations of different mountain wave regimes**

As part of my Master's thesis I tried to reproduce analytical results of the gravity wave drag (GWD) from linear analysis (WKB approximation). The results showed good agreement for non-hydrostatic and hydrostatic waves, while for inertia-gravity waves the numerical results aligned much better to the results of Miranda & James (yellow curve).

Further analysis of those simulations revealed interesting features of the horizontal momentum flux (MFx) and the Eliassen and Palm relation for inertia-gravity waves.
