For now my research interests are quite broad and varied. I enjoy programming and model development, but observations often complement the work and are just as interesting and fun. Here are some of the topics I like to think about...


<p style="text-decoration:underline; font-size:150%;">Snowpack modelling for avalanche forecasting</p>

<p style="text-decoration:underline; font-size:150%;">Snowpro - a Python package for Snowpack model output visualization</p>

This package was developed to read and visualize .pro files (Snowpack model output). At the LWD Tyrol we use it for various Python based postprocessing applications of snowpack simulations.

<p style="text-decoration:underline; font-size:150%;">Idealized numerical simulations of different mountain wave regimes</p>

As part of my Master's thesis I tried to reproduce analytical results of the gravity wave drag (GWD) from linear analysis (WKB approximation). The results showed good agreement for non-hydrostatic and hydrostatic waves, while for inertia-gravity waves the numerical results aligned much better to the results of Miranda & James (yellow curve). Results in Smith (1979) and Gill show smaller values for the GWD. Most likely, this is related to the considered dimensions of the analysis. Should look at the math soon :)

Further analysis of those simulations revealed interesting features of the horizontal momentum flux (MFx) and the Eliassen and Palm relation for inertia-gravity waves.

So many interesting things to do, so many interesting topics to investigate...
