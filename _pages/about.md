Not yet sure how to make this world a better place. Also not sure if it's worth the effort. Might as well just stick to my skies and surfboard and disappear. 

Hopefully, you like my photographs, but if you don't I think I can handle the disappointment.

On a more serious notice I am currently finishing my master degree in Atmospheric Sciences by writing my master thesis at the German aerospace center (DLR) Oberpfaffenhofen. Thanks to Covid I can still live in Innsbruck while working on the thesis.

I did my Bachelor degree in Aerospace Engineering and even wrote my thesis at **NASA**, but I am kind of more happy when talking about climate, glaciers and waves, instead of rockets or airplanes. Everything else is the same anyway.

Programming is a little bit important in today's science, so I'll just say **I love it**. I guess I ll find out how I much I really like **simulations** during my master thesis now, but what's also really interesting is this **artifical intelligence** (AI) thing everybody talks about. I managed to drive the car up the mountain (check out my Github), but there's so much more to learn about. Would be cool to combine some natural science research with evolved machine learning techniques. 

Looking forward to new challenges.

PS: I was also quite good in playing tennis once and traveled through Europe to play tournaments. I even ended up playing for a college team in the United States but my body had other ideas. Life turned out quite ok, too.

Looking forward to new adventures life is about to deliver.

// well .. if you came here to hear storys about getting lost in a snowstorm, riding bikes on 5000m or sharing tracks with wolves and bears ... I have to dissapoint you. You'll only get those storys sitting next to a campfire, on the chairlift or when sharing a cup of tea, waiting for the storm to clear.

But for now ... I'm basically just a kid in his mid-twenties, with a camera, a van, a pair of skies and a bike. I attended Akademie für angewandte Fotografie in Graz a few years ago, and got the chance to work as an assistant for some of my biggest idols when it comes to photography. I shomehow managed to get a Bachelor degree ein Sports Engineering somewhere in between ... don't ask me how. 

To be honest, I'm just doing what I love. Well, there are actually not many things that make me happy the way photography does. Even after living my dream for a few years now, travelling to so many stunning places ... getting that one shot still sends me shiver. And maybe ... maybe people can see that in my pictures. Or ... that's at least what I hope.
