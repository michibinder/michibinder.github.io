Not yet sure how to make this world a better place. Also not sure if it's worth the effort. Might as well just stick to my skis and surfboard and enjoy mother nature's gifts. 

Hopefully, you like my photographs, but if you don't I think I can handle the disappointment.

On a more serious notice I am currently finishing my M.Sc. in **Atmospheric Sciences** by writing my master thesis at the German aerospace center (DLR) Oberpfaffenhofen. Thanks to Covid I can still live in **Innsbruck** while working on the thesis and spend my free time running, skiing or slacklining in the mountains. Check out my proposal if interested...

I did my Bachelor degree in **Aerospace Engineering**, but I kind of find it more enjoying to talk about our climate, glaciers and atmosphere, instead of airplanes and rockets. Everything else is the same anyway.

Super happy with the topic of my thesis so far, but this **artifical intelligence** (AI) thing, everybody is talking about, does not seem too boring either. Would be cool to combine some natural science research with evolved machine learning techniques some day.

Looking forward to new challenges and another well deserved surf trip.

and even wrote my thesis at **NASA**

Looking forward to new adventures life is about to deliver.

I managed to drive the car up the mountain (check out my Github), but there's so much more to learn about.

// well .. if you came here to hear storys about getting lost in a snowstorm, riding bikes on 5000m or sharing tracks with wolves and bears ... I have to dissapoint you. You'll only get those storys sitting next to a campfire, on the chairlift or when sharing a cup of tea, waiting for the storm to clear.

But for now ... I'm basically just a kid in his mid-twenties, with a camera, a van, a pair of skies and a bike. I attended Akademie für angewandte Fotografie in Graz a few years ago, and got the chance to work as an assistant for some of my biggest idols when it comes to photography. I shomehow managed to get a Bachelor degree ein Sports Engineering somewhere in between ... don't ask me how. 

To be honest, I'm just doing what I love. Well, there are actually not many things that make me happy the way photography does. Even after living my dream for a few years now, travelling to so many stunning places ... getting that one shot still sends me shiver. And maybe ... maybe people can see that in my pictures. Or ... that's at least what I hope.

PS: I was also quite good in playing tennis once and traveled through Europe to play tournaments. I even ended up playing for a college team in the United States but injuries... yeah, whatever ... life turned out quite ok, too.
