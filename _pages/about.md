Dreaming of powder turns on one day and clean long surf rides on the other might regularly accompany long office hours. Lucky me, I can just load the van with a pair of skies or surfboard every now and then and chase all these amazing lines and waves Mother Nature has to offer.

In a time-lapse version my life could be summarized with...

- Played lots of Tennis during my school days
- Played more Tennis throughout Europe 
- Played College Tennis for the University of Kentucky and University of New Orleans, but more and more injuries restrained myself
- Went back home to southern Germany and got a Bachelor degree in **Aerospace Engeneering** alongside quite some tennis coaching
- Played less tennis, which got replaced by skitouring, surfing, slacklining, ...
- Wrote my Bachelor thesis at NASA Ames in Mountain View, CA, within the SOFIA project
- Picked up a camera to annoy my fellow people and justify a few more trips 
- Some traveling through Chile and Argentina for skitouring
- Started my Master degree in **Atmospheric Sciences** in Innsbruck

And now... I am finishing my M.Sc. by writing my thesis at the German aerospace center (DLR) Oberpfaffenhofen about gravity waves in the stratosphere.

In addition, I am also working for the avalanche warning service Tyrol in **Innsbruck**. Snowpack simulations and their analysis, visualisation, ... mainly coding and developing new tools for the avalanche forecaster on duty. You can find somewhat more info in the research section.

I hope you like my photographs, but, if not, I can probably handle the disappointment.

Many interesting things to do, many interesting things to study... 

Time lapse version:

- Tennis + School + Tennis + Soccer + Tennis
- College Tennis for UK (University of Kentucky) and UNO (University of New Orleans)
- Bachelor in Aerospace Engeneering and lots of tennis coaching
- Bachelor thesis at NASA Ames in Mountain View, CA, USA
- Some traveling through Chile and Argentina for skitouring
- IBK

A lot has happened to get here
A pair of skies, a surfboard

I am not yet sure how to make this world a better place. Actually, not even sure if it would be worth the effort. Should perhaps just load the van with skis and surfboards and enjoy Mother Nature's gifts.

Did my Bachelor in **Aerospace Engineering**, but I kind of find it more enjoying to talk about our climate, glaciers and atmosphere, instead of airplanes and rockets. Everything else is the same anyway.

Super happy with the topic of my thesis so far, but this **artifical intelligence** (AI) thing, everybody is talking about, does not seem too boring either. Would be cool to combine some natural science research with evolved machine learning techniques some day.

Looking forward to new challenges and another well deserved surf trip.

Thanks to Covid I can still live in **Innsbruck** while working on the thesis and spend my free time running, skiing or slacklining in the mountains.

and even wrote my thesis at **NASA**

Looking forward to new adventures life is about to deliver.

On a more serious notice, I am currently finishing my M.Sc. in **Atmospheric Sciences**. I write my thesis at the German aerospace center (DLR) Oberpfaffenhofen about gravity waves in the stratosphere. Check out my proposal if interested...

I managed to drive the car up the mountain (check out my Github), but there's so much more to learn about.

// well .. if you came here to hear storys about getting lost in a snowstorm, riding bikes on 5000m or sharing tracks with wolves and bears ... I have to dissapoint you. You'll only get those storys sitting next to a campfire, on the chairlift or when sharing a cup of tea, waiting for the storm to clear.

But for now ... I'm basically just a kid in his mid-twenties, with a camera, a van, a pair of skies and a bike. I attended Akademie für angewandte Fotografie in Graz a few years ago, and got the chance to work as an assistant for some of my biggest idols when it comes to photography. I shomehow managed to get a Bachelor degree ein Sports Engineering somewhere in between ... don't ask me how. 

To be honest, I'm just doing what I love. Well, there are actually not many things that make me happy the way photography does. Even after living my dream for a few years now, travelling to so many stunning places ... getting that one shot still sends me shiver. And maybe ... maybe people can see that in my pictures. Or ... that's at least what I hope.

PS: I was also quite good in playing tennis once and traveled through Europe to play tournaments. I even ended up playing for a college team in the United States but injuries... yeah, whatever ... life turned out quite ok, too.
